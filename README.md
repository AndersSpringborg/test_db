# test_db
A sample database with an integrated test suite, used to test your applications and database servers

This repository was migrated from [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/test-db).

See usage in the [MySQL docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/index.html)


## Where it comes from

The original data was created by Fusheng Wang and Carlo Zaniolo at 
Siemens Corporate Research. The data is in XML format.
http://timecenter.cs.aau.dk/software.htm

Giuseppe Maxia made the relational schema and Patrick Crews exported
the data in relational format.

The database contains about 300,000 employee records with 2.8 million 
salary entries. The export data is 167 MB, which is not huge, but
heavy enough to be non-trivial for testing.

The data was generated, and as such there are inconsistencies and subtle
problems. Rather than removing them, we decided to leave the contents
untouched, and use these issues as data cleaning exercises.

## Prerequisites

You need a MySQL database server (5.0+) and run the commands below through a 
user that has the following privileges:

    SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, 
    CREATE, DROP, RELOAD, REFERENCES, 
    INDEX, ALTER, SHOW DATABASES, 
    CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, 
    LOCK TABLES, EXECUTE, CREATE VIEW
